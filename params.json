Practice Mode is the single-player mode to test-drive race tracks which are at the moment only two. I can create more for fun in the future. Game stats are stored locally. I planned to use stats stored to use for determining pole positions in multiplayer races though the service I integrated into the project was shut down recently so I ripped it off. In Multiplayer Mode, up to 4 players race agains each other over networking to complete the track.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
