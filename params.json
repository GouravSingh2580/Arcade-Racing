{"name":"Arcade Racing","tagline":"Source code and assets of my graduation project: Arcade Racing Game","body":"### Welcome to my graduation project: Arcade Racing.\r\n\r\n**Project Summary**: The game consists of two game modes. Practice Mode is the single-player mode to test-drive race tracks which are at the moment only two. I can create more for fun in the future. Game stats are stored locally. I planned to use stats stored to use for determining pole positions in multiplayer races though the service I integrated into the project was shut down recently so I ripped it off. In Multiplayer Mode, up to 4 players race agains each other over networking to complete the track.\r\n\r\n**Video link**: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l6KHP2G44o\r\n\r\n### Tech Uused\r\n* C++\r\n* [Ogre3D](http://www.ogre3d.org/): Rendering Engine\r\n* [Bullet Physics](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/)\r\n* [MyGUI](http://mygui.info/)\r\n* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)\r\n* [rapidxml](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/)\r\n* [FMOD](http://www.fmod.org/)\r\n* [OgreMax](http://www.ogremax.com/)\r\n\r\n### Tools Used\r\n* Visual Studio 2013\r\n* Autodesk Maya 2013\r\n* MyGUI Layout Editor\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
